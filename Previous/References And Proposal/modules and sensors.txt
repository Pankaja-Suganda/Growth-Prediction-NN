Steps to goal

* Data preprocessing and data cleaning.
• Data splitting into training, validation and test datasets.
• DL/LSTM, SVR, and RF model design and use to generate one step ahead
prediction.

methods

the most successful techniques are Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector
Regression (SVR), M5-prime Regression Trees, Random Forests (RF), and K-Nearest
Neighbors

 the DL technique (using a LSTM model)
outperformed other traditional ML techniques, such as SVR(Support Vector Regression) and RF, in terms of MSE, RMSE
and MAE error criteria
